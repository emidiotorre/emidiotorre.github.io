Hi, ðŸ˜Ž
I'm a web developer based in Bari.

I'm currently working with [Kirby](http://getkirby.com), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

In my spare time i like to experiment with new technologies and languages such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/).

I am a self taught technologist, courious about the bits and bolts that make this digital world work.

I graduated in Industrial Design at the Polytechnic University of Milan, but during my studies i have developed my tech interest and started working in the field as a freelancer.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emidiotorre).

Thanks for reading!
