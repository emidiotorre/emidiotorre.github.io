After the last two years in which i didn't update my old website, i think it's time to make some space, clear my mind, and start blank.

This is my new website, made with jekyll, so it is simple to update and effortless to mantain.

I left the cool super catchy stuff to the past.

This is the place where i will write about my personal findings and explorations, as a note for my future self about the path i've followed.

In this process i think it is extremely important to share the relevant knowledge one has acquired with the community, i will do my best to write good quality content.

## Topics i am interested in right now

This is a brief list of the topics that i plan to write about in the next weeks:

- E-commerce development in Django
- Vue.js
- UX and UI
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- InfoSec and CTFs

If you have some topics to suggest, or some ideas to discuss, don't hesitate to catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emidiotorre).
